# Preact/TypeScript/NextJS/SCSS boilerplate

Heavily inspired by following repos:
https://github.com/rockyliyanlok/nextjs-100
https://github.com/pepecos/nextjs-preactjs-boilerplate

Thanks to those guys for making this so hassle-free to setup! 
I wished to update NextJS to 12+ and Preact to PreactX+, and ran into some issues,
they should be resolved in this boilerplate. Sorry if there's some leftover messy code, 
please submit PRs if you have suggestions for improving the boilerplate.
